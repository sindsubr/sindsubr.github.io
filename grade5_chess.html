        <h2>Lesson 1: Introduction to Chess</h2>
        <p>Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board. Each player controls 16 pieces with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king.</p>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>The goal of chess is to put the opponent's king in a position where it cannot escape, called checkmate.</p>
        <h3>The Chessboard:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The chessboard has 64 squares, alternating between light and dark colors.</li>
            <li>The squares are divided into <strong>ranks</strong> (horizontal rows, numbered 1 to 8) and <strong>files</strong> (vertical columns, labeled a to h).</li>
            <li>The pieces are set up with the white square at the bottom-right corner for both players.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this lesson, we will explore how the board is set up and the goal of the game.</p>

            <p>Notice the ranks (1-8) and files (a-h) for identifying each square.</p>

    <!-- Lesson 2: The Chess Pieces -->
    <div class="lesson">
        <h2>Lesson 2: The Chess Pieces</h2>
        <p>Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>King:</strong> Moves one square in any direction. The most important piece, but not the strongest.</li>
            <li><strong>Queen:</strong> Moves any number of squares in any direction. The most powerful piece.</li>
            <li><strong>Rook:</strong> Moves any number of squares, but only in straight lines (horizontally or vertically).</li>
            <li><strong>Bishop:</strong> Moves any number of squares diagonally.</li>
            <li><strong>Knight:</strong> Moves in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.</li>
            <li><strong>Pawn:</strong> Moves forward one square but captures diagonally. On the first move, it can move two squares forward.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="lesson">
        <h2>Lesson 3: Setting up the Chessboard</h2>
        <p>In this lesson, we'll learn how to set up the chessboard properly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the rooks in the corners of the board on squares a1, h1 (for White), and a8, h8 (for Black).</li>
            <li>Next to the rooks, place the knights on b1, g1 (for White), and b8, g8 (for Black).</li>
            <li>Next to the knights, place the bishops on c1, f1 (for White), and c8, f8 (for Black).</li>
            <li>The queen goes on her color: d1 for White and d8 for Black.</li>
            <li>The king goes on the remaining square: e1 for White and e8 for Black.</li>
            <li>Place all pawns on the second rank (row 2 for White, row 7 for Black).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson">
        <h2>Lesson 4: Basic Rules of Chess</h2>
        <p>Here are the basic rules you need to follow in a game of chess:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>White always goes first.</li>
            <li>The goal is to checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is under threat and cannot escape.</li>
            <li>Pawns can be promoted to any piece (except a king) when they reach the other side of the board.</li>
            <li>Pieces capture by landing on an opponent’s piece (except for pawns, which capture diagonally).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that you know the rules, try playing a few games!</p>

    <!-- Lesson 5: How to Win a Game (Check and Checkmate) -->
    <div class="lesson">
        <h2>Lesson 5: How to Win a Game (Check and Checkmate)</h2>
        <p>To win a game, you need to checkmate your opponent’s king. Here's how:</p>
        <h3>Check:</h3>
        <p>The king is in check if it is attacked by an opponent's piece. The king must get out of check by moving, blocking, or capturing the threatening piece.</p>
        <h3>Checkmate:</h3>
        <p>The king is in checkmate if it is in check and has no legal moves to escape.</p>
        <h3>Stalemate:</h3>
        <p>A game ends in a draw if there are no legal moves left and the king is not in check. This is called a stalemate.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Lesson 6: Special Moves (Castling, En Passant, Promotion) -->
    <div class="lesson">
        <h2>Lesson 6: Special Moves (Castling, En Passant, Promotion)</h2>
        <p>There are three special moves in chess that you need to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Castling:</strong> This is the only time you can move two pieces at once (the king and a rook). The king moves two squares toward the rook, and the rook moves to the square next to the king.</li>
            <li><strong>En Passant:</strong> This is a special pawn capture that occurs when a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position, and an opponent’s pawn could have captured it if it had moved only one square forward. The opponent can capture it as if it moved only one square.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> If a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it can be promoted to any piece (except a king).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Lesson 7: Basic Chess Tactics (Fork, Pin, Skewer) -->
    <div class="lesson">
        <h2>Lesson 7: Basic Chess Tactics (Fork, Pin, Skewer)</h2>
        <p>Let’s learn some basic tactics to help you win more games:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fork:</strong> A single piece attacks two or more of the opponent’s pieces at the same time.</li>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/Shashinottharoor/phpHtx2lD.png" alt="Fork Example" height="300" width="300">
                <p>Example of a fork, where one piece attacks two pieces at once.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Pin:</strong> A piece is forced to stay in place because moving it would expose a more valuable piece (like the king or queen) behind it.</li>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/v1/images_users/tiny_mce/Shashinottharoor/php7mGAG1.png" alt="Pin Example" height="300" width="300">
                <p>Example of a pin, where moving a piece would expose the queen.</p>
            </div>
            <li><strong>Skewer:</strong> A piece is attacked, and when it moves, a more valuable piece behind it is captured.</li>
            <div class="image-container">

                <p>Example of a skewer, where the more valuable piece is behind the attacked piece.</p>
